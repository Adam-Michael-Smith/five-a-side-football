JavaScript plan and football pitch for character information for a 5-a-side football league - Slytherin vs the rest of Hogwarts.

Set up base character stats using an array of objects, using 'this' keyword to access the object prior to initialising, to populate the player's personal greeting. Also coded a football field using CSS, ready for when I test ideas in a new branch.
